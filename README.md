# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict customer churn using supervised machine learning models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. By analyzing customer behavior data, the model helps businesses identify customers likely to leave and take proactive retention actions.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses. This project builds a classification model to predict whether a customer will churn based on historical data, enabling better customer retention strategies.

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Scaled numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized churn distribution
   - Identified key influencing features

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Trained Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost
   - Evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix

4. **Model Selection**
   - Chose XGBoost for its superior performance

---

## 📊 Results

- XGBoost achieved the best balance of accuracy and recall.
- Identified key factors contributing to customer churn, such as contract type and monthly charges.
